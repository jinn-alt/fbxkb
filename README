FBXkb is simple and lightweight X11 keyboard switcher, which provides visual
information about current keyboard layout. It shows a flag of current keyboard
layout in a systray area and allows you to switch to another one.
FBXkb requires NETWM (www.freedesktop.org) compliant window manager to work.
It's written in C and uses the GTK+2 library only (no GNOME is needed).
